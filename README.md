# NIELIT_2023_Marks_Calculator

This app is made specifically to calculate the marks of the NIELIT Scientist B, Scientific Officer/Engineer and Scientific and Technical Assistant A.

# How to Run the code.
1) Take the pull of the repo.
2) Install Necessary Libraries
3) Put your pdf file location on pdf_file_path on line 77
4) Run it.

# OUTPUT:
Output is:
1) It will print all wrong question attempts.
2) Then it prints Total number Correct, NotCorrect, NotAttempted questions
3) Then it shows the total score
4) And total count of question it parsed.


# Customize:
You can customize this according to your needs.
In the method calculate_score(answers), you can customize like count of correct answers to be printed etc.
Currently, I'm only printing the incorrect question id's and its count.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
As said already, I've made this specifically for the NIELIT ANSWER KEY check.
As I'm not aware of the pdf inputs right now, this app is restricted to checking the above pdf only.
In the Future, I will work on improving this app to parse most of the pdf's with the pattern given.
